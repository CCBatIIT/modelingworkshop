In other terms, we can approximate the behavior of a physical system by knowing the characteristics of its components and applying Newton's laws of motion. By solving the equations of motion, we can obtain a molecular trajectory of the system, which is a series of snapshots with the positions and velocities of all its particles, as well as its potential energy. To do so, we define functions, called force fields, which provide an approximate description of all the forces applied to each particle in the system. We then use numerical integrators to solve the initial value problem for the system and obtain the trajectory.

When a ligand (or a drug) approaches a macromolecule (protein) in solution, it encounters a structure in constant motion. Also, ligands may induce conformational changes in the macromolecule that can best accommodate the small molecule. Such conformations may not be discovered with static methods. Accordingly, binding sites that are not observed in static ligand-free structures, but can be discovered with MD simulations, are sometimes called *cryptic binding sites* ([_J Med Chem_ (2016), **59**(9), 4035‐4061](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01684)). The identification of such binding sites with MD simulation can kickstart new drug discovery campaigns.

However, the timescale of binding and unbinding events lies in the millisecond to second range. Enhanced sampling methods aim to accelerate the conformational sampling ([_J Med Chem._ 2016, **59(9)**, 4035-61](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01684)).\n","\n","One of these is **Free energy perturbation (FEP)** (also called alchemical free energy calculation), which computes the free energy difference when going from a state A to another state B. It is often employed in lead optimization to evaluate small modification at the ligand, that may boost the binding affinity for the desired target. The ligand from state A is thereby gradually transformed into the ligand of state B by simulating several intermediate (\"alchemical\") states ([alchemistry](http://www.alchemistry.org/wiki/Main_Page)). \n","\n","Another technique for free-energy calculations is **Umbrella sampling (US)**. US enforces sampling along a collective variable (CV) by performing staged simulations with an energetic bias. The bias usually takes the form of a harmonic potential, hence the term \"umbrella\". Its goal is to sample high-energy regions along the CV. However, the use in drug design is limited by the high computational cost.\n","\n","In contrast, **Steered MD (SMD)** follows a different approach: it applies external forces to the system. Those forces are time-dependent and facilitate the unbinding of the ligand from the target. The SMD calculates the final force exerted on the system.
